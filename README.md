My Ecommerce Project

This project is a full stack project consisting of html, css, bootstrap, javascript, python and django framework with postgresl.
The project is an ecommerce clothing store whereby users can browse the store and make online purchases on their desired products.


UX

As a user, they can browse the store and when they are ready to make a purchase, they will have to sign up for an account on my website in order to be able to add the goods to cart and checkout.
The design is relatively simple, with a display that shows all the products on a single page as it is a small niche business, pictures and other media contents are stored on AWS server and the website is hosted on heroku via postsgresl.

Features

Users see what they like, they can read the description, sizing and view the pictures of the product before adding to cart using the up and down button or just keying it in manually.
When they are ready to buy they can register an account by clicking on the register tab on the navbar and fill out all the necessary details and click the create account. 
After doing so they are immediately logged in and they can proceed to make payment by clicking on the cart tab and clicking on the checkout button.
Fill in all the necessary card payment details and address details to process payment, if the credit card is not a valid one there will be a message that states that the card cannot be processed and that the payment is unsuccessful.

Much of the website layout and structure is based off the tutorial provided by Code Institute and as such the libraries and framework that is being used in this site is the same.

<!--Testing-->
<!--In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.-->

<!--Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.-->

<!--For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:-->

<!--Contact form:-->
<!--Go to the "Contact Us" page-->
<!--Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears-->
<!--Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears-->
<!--Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.-->
<!--In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.-->

<!--You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.-->

<!--If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.-->

<!--Deployment-->
<!--This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).-->

<!--In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:-->

<!--Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?-->
<!--Different configuration files?-->
<!--Separate git branch?-->
<!--In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.-->
